<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a 4th year computer science student at Wilfrid Laurier University with a passion for learning and leadership! I get myself very involved on and off campus to foster connections among students and help them to grow their skills. Ever since I wrote my first hello, world with the Turing language I have been obsessed with learning new tools, frameworks, and technologies!
